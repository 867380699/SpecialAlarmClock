# Alarm
By default, all alarms are canceled when a device shuts down. 
To prevent this from happening, you can design your application to automatically restart a repeating alarm if the user reboots the device.

# Broadcast
The broadcast message itself is wrapped in an Intent object whose action string identifies the event that occurred (for example android.intent.action.AIRPLANE_MODE).

Apps can receive broadcasts in two ways: through manifest-declared receivers and context-registered receivers.
